Adds settings to improve accessibility and automatically corrects accessibility issues.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin adds settings to improve accessibility and automatically corrects accessibility issues.
It gathers several small improvements implemented during my projects. It might not fit you 100%, it has no settings pages.

== What it does ==

== Menus ==
- Removes the "Title attribute" field from menu items
- Automatically adds an aria-label containing "_menu title_ **(new tab)**" attribute to links that open in a new tab (target blank)
- Replace empty link (href="#") by span
- Adds an aria-label field to menu items (which is automatically filled with "_menu aria label_ **(new tab)**" if the link opens in a new tab)

== Editor ==

== Button block ==
- Automatically adds an aria-label containing "_button text_ **(new tab)**" attribute to links that open in a new tab (target blank)
- Adds an aria-label setting to Block Toolbar (which is automatically filled with "_button aria label_ **(new tab)**" if the link opens in a new tab)
