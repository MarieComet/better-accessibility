# Better Accessibility

## Description 

This WordPress plugin adds settings to improve accessibility and automatically corrects accessibility issues.
It gathers several small improvements implemented during my projects. It might not fit you 100%, it has no settings pages.

## What it does

### Menus
- Removes the "Title attribute" field from menu items
- Automatically adds an aria-label containing "_menu title_ **(new tab)**" attribute to links that open in a new tab (target blank)
- Replace empty link (href="#") by span
- Adds an aria-label field to menu items (which is automatically filled with "_menu aria label_ **(new tab)**" if the link opens in a new tab)

### Editor

#### Button block
- Automatically adds an aria-label containing "_button text_ **(new tab)**" attribute to links that open in a new tab (target blank)
- Adds an aria-label setting to Block Toolbar (which is automatically filled with "_button aria label_ **(new tab)**" if the link opens in a new tab)
